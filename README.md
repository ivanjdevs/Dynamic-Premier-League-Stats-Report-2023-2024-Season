# Dynamic-Premier-League-Stats-Report-2023-2024-Season
This project provides a dynamic report built in Power BI showing some statistics of the English Premier League season 2023-2024.

The project combines the use of Python and Power BI. In Python, I use web scraping tools to extract data about the current Premier League season from a sports website. I then perform a cleaning and formatting process and organise the data into a dataframe. Finally, the prepared dataframe is exported into a csv file. Along with this csv file, two additional xlsx files are loaded into Power BI and the dynamic report is created. 

Just by clicking on the team name button the report shows statistics for each team such as goals scored, average goals scored, total points, points scored per game, wins, draws and defeats, top scorer. It also displays overall statistics for the competition.
